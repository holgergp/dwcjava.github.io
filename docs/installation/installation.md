There are two different types of installation for the DWCJ:


- For those who want to develop applications or web tools using the DWCJ,
follow the [Users installation page](/docs/installation/users).

- Developers who want to also make changes to the DWCJ itself can follow
the [Contributors installation page](/docs/installation/contributors) to begin making changes to the API.
